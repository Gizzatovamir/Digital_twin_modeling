Repo for digital Twin modeling

The article is devoted to digital twin systems usage
 focusing on utilizing them at the operational stage in cyber
physical and socio-cyber-physical systems building process. The
 article discusses the issues of automatic construction (synthesis)
 and maintenance of digital twin system in an up-to-date state.
 A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that digital
 twin is initially considered as an element of digital twin system.
 The digital twin reference architecture of the dynamic runtime
 environment is proposed. The requirements for models embedded
 in digital twins are formulated. The classification of tasks
 of model synthesis is presented. Synthesis algorithms for the
 most common types of models, including human models and
 algorithms for keeping the model system up-to-date based on
 the use of dynamic automatic networks are developed. The main
 contribution is in the proposed models of digital twins, model
 synthesis algorithms, as well as algorithms for keeping the model
 of digital twin system up-to-date. The described approach may be
 of interest to specialists engaged in research and development of
 various types of cyber-physical and socio-cyber-physical systems.
 Further research and development will be conducted first of all,
 in the field of expanding the list of objects acting as an object
 of observation and creating frameworks aimed at developers of
 real systems based on Internet of Things platforms, as well as in
 the field of model training.
